     <h1>Pros and cons of IoT</h1>
                <p>Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:</p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;</li>
                    <li>improved communication between connected electronic devices;</li>
                    <li>transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money</li>
                    <li>automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention.</li>
                </ol>



                <h1>Some disadvantages of IoT include the following:</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.
                    </li>
